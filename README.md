# Construction Norms Project Report

## Overview
This repository contains the full documentation for the "Construction Norms Project Report: Mounting the Panel with the CKY101 Tower Crane." The work was completed as part of the coursework at the Faculty of Economics and Construction Management, Hanoi University of Civil Engineering.

The project report outlines:
- Methods for formulating construction norms in a real-world setting.
- Detailed data collection via field observations and photographic timekeeping.
- Mathematical adjustments and correction methods for cyclic and non-cyclic production elements.
- Labor norm design, including operating times, downtime analysis, and the calculation of labor unit costs.
- Analysis of alternative worker team compositions and associated cost-wage evaluations.

## Methodology

The project employs the **Field Observation Method** ("ph∆∞∆°ng ph√°p quan s√°t th·ª±c t·∫ø t·∫°i hi·ªán tr∆∞·ªùng") for norm establishment, involving:

1. Preparation for data collection.
2. Field observations and data collection.
3. Data processing and adjustments (including cycle and non-cycle processes).
4. Calculation and presentation of normative values for practical application.

Data collection methods include:

- Selective Timekeeping Method (B·∫•m gi·ªù ch·ªçn l·ªçc - BGCL)
- Working Day Photography Method (Ch·ª•p ·∫£nh ng√†y l√†m vi·ªác - CANLV)

## üìä Key Results

This project successfully developed and implemented detailed construction labor norms for panel assembly using the CKY101 tower crane. The key results achieved include:

- **Established Labor Norms:**
  - Mixing, transferring, spreading mortar: **223.47 person-minutes/m¬≥**
  - Hooking panel to crane: **9.76 person-minutes/panel**
  - Adjustable anchor fastening: **37.94 person-minutes/panel**
  - Mortar vascular insertion: **2.22 person-minutes/m¬≤**

- **Calculated Labor Norm per Panel:**
  - Total labor norm per panel: **1.81 working hours/panel**
  - Average worker rank: **3.17/7**
  - Labor unit cost per panel: **50,367.51 VND/panel**

- **Optimal Team Composition:**
  - Level 2 workers: **2 people**
  - Level 3 workers: **1 person**
  - Level 4 workers: **3 people**
  - Average worker rank: **3.17/7**

- **Standard Conditions for Norm Implementation:**
  - Workplace arranged according to safety and environmental standards.
  - CKY101 tower crane specifications:
    - Lifting capacity: **3-10 tons**
    - Reach: **13-30 m**
    - Lifting height: **20.8 m**
  - Weather conditions: **23¬∞C, light rain**

- **Data Verification:**
  - Verified accuracy through statistical methods (weekday photography method - CANLV), ensuring reliability of established norms.

- **Compliance with Regulations:**
  - Calculated labor norms and unit prices according to current regulations (Circular 15/2019/TT-BXD), ensuring compliance with state management requirements.
